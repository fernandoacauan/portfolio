                    <p>Hi! My name is Fernando Acauan, and I’m a Computer Engineering student currently in my third semester.</p>
                    <p>My journey into the world of technology began in 2011, when I got my first computer. That moment ignited a deep and lasting passion for understanding how computers work — a passion that has only grown stronger over the years.</p>
                    <p>I have a particular interest in building emulators, where I dive into low-level systems, instruction sets, and hardware architecture.</p>
                    <p>I'm also passionate about developing desktop applications using C, C++, and C#, always aiming to build powerful, efficient, and well-structured software.</p>
                    <p>Whether it's an academic project or a personal challenge, I approach each opportunity with discipline, precision, and a relentless desire to grow.</p>
